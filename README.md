# List of Euler-Bricks


## What is this?

This repository contains a list of all three dimensional Euler-bricks within '1 <= **a** < **b** < **c** <= 10 million' â€“ found using brute force on a MacBook Pro.

Euler-bricks are cuboids where all edges and all diagonals have integer lengths. A perfect Euler-brick would have a space diagonal with integer length as well. Such a cuboid has not yet been found and also not yet been proven to not exist.

*Spoiler Alert: There are no perfect Euler-bricks in this repo.*


## some facts

The smallest Euler-brick there is has the dimensions *44*, *117*, *240*. The one with the biggest side **a** that I could find has the dimensions of *8.618.610*, *9.100.520*, *9.854.208*.

In total, this list contains 139.592 Euler-bricks, only 659 of which are not multiples of smaller bricks.

## Why?

Yeah, don't ask. I guess this counts as a hobby of some sort.
Does anyone really need this repository - I think not.
